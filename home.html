            <p>Probiotic skincare for blemishes may be invisible to the naked eye, but probiotics are a blessing for banishing blemishes. Hailed for their positive impact on gut health, the benefits of probiotics in skincare are now being harnessed by beauty experts. So, what is probiotic skincare, and why is it the secret to calm, clear, hydrated skin?With science singing the praises of probiotics for skin, cutting-edge natural beauty brands like Antipodes® have embraced the use of probiotics in skincare.  Culture Probiotic Night Recovery Water Cream is the result of eighteen months of research and development. With the power of good bacteria, the water-rich moisturiser cultivates healthy looking skin while you sleep.


                Antipodes® uses a special probiotic strain for their ground-breaking new product. Kalibiome AGE Probiotic: a super clever, super innovative postbiotic technology. This non-live bacteria is extracted from live cells and double fermented to remove toxins. It's scientifically shown to support the skin barrier by sealing the skin’s epidermal layers and balancing the microbiome. While you sleep, the cloud-soft cream gets to work on helping to decrease roughness and redness in the skin.  Supporting this clever technology is plant hyaluronic acid, a powerful hydrator. Mamaku black fern is a New Zealand bioactive that promotes a renewed complexion. Clean, powerful natural ingredients.

                   <h5>How to treat hormonal acne at any age</h5>
                    <p>Hormones: can’t live with them, can’t live without them. Hormones are integral to our bodies and our skin. They regulate our emotions, our metabolism, our reproductive cycles, and so much more. Hormonal skin changes can result in skin that’s prone to breakouts, skin blemishes, dullness, and irritation. Or just skin that’s a little less than happy! Thankfully, our skincare can help treat hormonal acne and bring harmony to skin.</p>
